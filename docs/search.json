This portfolio is to display some of the work I have done throughout my time in university, and to showcase some of the skills I have gained through the work I have done. It is also to indicate the type of work I can produce based on different contexts and different courses that I have taken through university. Thanks for taking the time to have a look!\n\n\n\n",
